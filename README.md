# FinalProject

Elapse and HelloiOS are the first attempts I made at iOS programming in ObjectiveC. Put It Down is live on the AppStore. 
I am currently working on branch 1.2 which replaces iAds with AdMob ads, adds MapKit functionality with pins at the
beginning of the user's route, end of the route, and a pin for each time the user touches the phone while driving.
