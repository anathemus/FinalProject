# FinalProject

Elapse and HelloiOS are the first attempts I made at iOS programming in ObjectiveC. Put It Down is live on the AppStore. 
Version 2.0 includes AdMob ads, CoreData, Location Services, checks the angle of the gyroscope each second against
the previous second. If the angle is more than 30 degrees, it registers that the phone was picked up and pins the map.
The driver is alerted with sound and vibration. The map can be saved for later retrieval through CoreData and TableView by selecting from the main menu.
